/**
 * The capabilities a plugin manifest may declare and a workspace consents to on install.
 *
 * Capabilities may authorize more than one caller. Each entry names all current callers:
 *
 * - `plugin.secrets.read` — the backend run may call `env.BONOBO.secrets.get(name)`.
 * - `outbound.fetch` — the backend run may `fetch` the manifest's `outboundOrigins`.
 * - `workspace.files.read` — the plugin's UI pages and file views may read workspace files, and so
 *   may backend runs. It puts the `files:list`, `files:read`, and `files:download` scopes on the
 *   frame's UI token and `files:list` + `files:read` on a backend run's token. A run always reads
 *   with the acting member's visibility, so it can never see a restricted folder that member
 *   cannot open.
 * - `workspace.files.write` — authorizes `files:write` on a sealed processing-phase service grant,
 *   capped by an exact destination path prefix. It never reaches the frame. The interactive
 *   exchange never mints that scope; the service gets it through the seal-processing route. A
 *   sealed grant may use the `/api/v1/files/service-uploads/*` routes, write Markdown inside its
 *   seal through `/api/v1/files/write`, and archive a file it wrote through
 *   `/api/v1/files/plugin-archive`.
 * - `workspace.files.create-read-only` — lets the service request a direct read-only lock when it
 *   creates a file. Declaring it also requires `workspace.files.write`.
 * - `workspace.files.own-write` — backend invoke runs may create, update, and archive files inside
 *   folders the plugin created and stamped as its own. It never reaches files a member or another
 *   plugin owns. Declaring it also requires `workspace.files.write`.
 * - `workspace.files.own-access` — backend invoke runs may lock the plugin's own files read-only
 *   and choose which members can read them. Declaring it also requires `workspace.files.own-write`.
 * - `plugin.data.read` — backend runs, UI pages and file views, and eligible Council service grants
 *   may read the plugin's own document store.
 * - `plugin.data.write` — backend runs and eligible Council service grants may write the plugin's own
 *   document store. A frame's UI token never receives the write scope, whatever the installation
 *   accepted. Declaring it also requires `plugin.data.read`.
 * - `plugin.data.user-write` — the plugin's UI pages and file views may create, change, and delete
 *   documents in that store as the acting member. The write never rides the frame's UI token: it
 *   runs through the app's own member-attributed mutations. Declaring it also requires
 *   `plugin.data.read`.
 * - `plugin.backend.invoke` — the plugin's UI pages and file views may start a backend run on one
 *   of the manifest's declared `backend.endpoints` through the host invoke route. Declaring it
 *   requires a plugin backend with at least one declared endpoint.
 * - `plugin.service.connect` — lets the plugin's UI token from a page or a file view participate
 *   in the service-grant exchange, but grants no API scope itself. The exchange reads only the
 *   session's installation and member, so both frame kinds work the same. The outside service must
 *   also authenticate with the exchange secret from the plugin's publisher-managed service
 *   registration; the registration's scopes decide what the grant carries. Declaring it requires
 *   `plugin.data.read` or `workspace.files.write` as well, because a grant that carries no scope
 *   buys the service nothing.
 * - `ui.outbound.fetch` — the plugin's UI pages and file views, running in the member's browser, may
 *   call the manifest's `uiOutboundOrigins`. It is enforced as `connect-src` in the frame's CSP. It
 *   and `uiOutboundOrigins` require each other: neither may be declared alone.
 * - `workspace.members.read` — the plugin's UI pages and file views may list every member of the
 *   workspace, as user ids and display names. Email is never returned. Without it a frame can still
 *   resolve names for ids it already holds, which enumerates nobody. Every member reads the roster
 *   under one rule, including a member who signed in anonymously.
