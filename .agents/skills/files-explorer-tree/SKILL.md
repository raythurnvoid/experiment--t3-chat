# Source Of Truth Files

Primary:

- `../../../packages/app/src/routes/w/$workspaceName/$projectName/files/-components/files-sidebar.tsx`
- `../../../packages/app/src/routes/w/$workspaceName/$projectName/files/-components/files-sidebar.css`
- `../../../packages/app/src/routes/w/$workspaceName/$projectName/files/index.tsx`
- `../../../packages/app/convex/files_nodes.ts`
- `../../../packages/app/shared/files.ts`
- `../../../packages/app/src/lib/files.ts`
- `../../../packages/app/vendor/headless-tree/packages/core/src/index.ts`
- `../../../packages/app/vendor/headless-tree/packages/react/src/index.ts`
- `../../../packages/app/vendor/headless-tree/packages/react/src/react-compiler/index.tsx`

# Architecture Overview

The Files sidebar is implemented in `files-sidebar.tsx` on top of `@headless-tree` with Convex-backed data.

- Tree engine: `@headless-tree/core` + `@headless-tree/react`
- Backend data: Convex `files` query/mutations
- Primary data source: `files.get_tree_nodes_list`
- Local state is UI-only (`expandedItems`, search/selection, busy/pending flags) plus derived indexes from query data
- Prefer Convex mutation `optimisticUpdate` over ad-hoc local mirrored tree state
- Backend item types: `"root" | "node"`
- Node kinds: `"folder" | "file"`
- Placeholder rows are UI-only render artifacts

# Data Model And Contracts

- `files_TreeItem` shape is defined in `../../../packages/app/convex/files_nodes.ts`.
- `files_ROOT_ID` and `files_create_tree_root` are in `../../../packages/app/shared/files.ts` and re-exported by `../../../packages/app/src/lib/files.ts`.
- Backend returns root/node items only; placeholder rows are client-rendered.
- Folder nodes can have children, expand/collapse, and receive drops.
- File nodes are leaves and open in the editor.
- Clicking a folder opens an active direct child file named `readme.md` when present; otherwise the route renders a folder listing.

# Main Components

Main component:

- `FilesSidebar` (name retained to avoid a large route/component rename)

Main sections:

- `FilesSidebarHeader`
- `FilesSidebarSearch`
- `FilesSidebarTree`

Tree-item components:

- `FilesSidebarTreeItem`
- `FilesSidebarTreeItemArrow`
- `FilesSidebarTreeItemTitle`
- `FilesSidebarTreeItemIcon`
- `FilesSidebarTreeItemPrimaryContent`
- `FilesSidebarTreeItemPrimaryAction`
- `FilesSidebarTreeItemMetaLabel`
- `FilesSidebarTreeItemActions`
- `FilesSidebarTreeItemSecondaryAction`
- `FilesSidebarTreeItemSecondaryActionCreateFile`
- `FilesSidebarTreeItemMoreAction`
- `FilesSidebarTreeItemTrack`
- `FilesSidebarTreeItemPlaceholder`

# State And Behavior Flows

## Server-Driven Data

- Sidebar queries `files.get_tree_nodes_list`.
- Tree collection maps/sets are derived from query results (`useMemo`) and rebuilt from server data.
- Loading/empty states are derived from query presence and visible IDs.

## Search

- Search input is debounced and consumed through a deferred query value.
- Visible IDs are computed from title matches plus ancestor chain inclusion.
- Ancestors of matched files/folders remain visible.
- Search-open snapshots expansion state and auto-expands relevant parents; search-close restores prior expansion.

## Selection And Primary Action

- Primary click implements single select, toggle-select, and shift-range.
- Non-modifier click runs primary action for node items.
- File primary action navigates to the file.
- Folder primary action navigates to child `readme.md` if present; otherwise it navigates to the folder listing.
- In multi-select mode, selection anchor files active track highlighting.

## Create, Rename, Archive, Unarchive

- Root actions create `New File` and `New Folder`.
- Folder row actions can create child files and folders.
- File rows do not show child-creation actions.
- Default generated names are sibling-aware: `new-file.md`, `new-file-2.md`, `new-folder`, `new-folder-2`.
- Rename uses `files.rename_node` with Convex `optimisticUpdate` for immediate title feedback.
- Archive/unarchive uses `files.archive_nodes` / `files.unarchive_nodes`.

## Drag And Drop

- In-tree DnD uses headless-tree `onDrop` -> `files.move_nodes`.
- `canDrop` guards target kind, self-drop, and descendant-drop.
- Root and folders can receive drops.
- Files cannot receive drops.

# Headless-Tree Configuration Highlights

`useTree<files_TreeItem>` configuration includes:

- `rootItemId: files_ROOT_ID`
- controlled `expandedItems` + `setExpandedItems`
- `canReorder: false`
- sync data loader + selection + hotkeys + DnD + renaming + expand-all + click behavior + prop memoization features
- node-only `canDrag` and `canRename`
- folder-only `isItemFolder`
- guarded `canDrop`

# Architectural Invariants

1. Keep placeholder behavior client-only and non-mutable.
2. Keep tree record data server-driven from Convex query; do not introduce local mirror/fallback state.
3. Preserve ancestor-aware search visibility and search expansion-restore behavior.
4. Preserve custom selection semantics and selection-anchor behavior.
5. Keep DnD safety guards (self/descendant/kind) and root-zone feedback behavior.
6. Keep pending state split (`isBusy` and `pendingActionNodeIds`) for correct UI gating.
7. Prefer Convex optimistic updates over manual local tree patching.
8. Do not let file nodes act as folders.

# Verification Checklist

- Tree updates come from `get_tree_nodes_list`.
- Search keeps ancestor chain for matching files/folders.
- Search-open expands relevant branches and search-close restores prior expansion.
- Selection modes and anchor behavior are correct.
- Root create can create a file and a folder.
- Folder create can create child files/folders.
- File rows do not show child creation actions and are not expandable.
- Rename guards and optimistic rename behavior are correct.
- Archive/unarchive and archived filter/toggle behavior is correct.
- DnD allows legal moves, blocks drops onto files, and root-zone feedback works.
- Placeholder nodes are never sent to mutations.
