Rule files located in `.cursor/rules` provide vital information to you, the AI Assistant, to help the user in the best possible way.

When writing rule files, always refer to the AI assistant as "you" rather than using first-person perspective. For example, write "you must follow these guidelines" instead of "I must follow these guidelines." This ensures consistency across all rule files and makes the instructions more directly applicable to the AI assistant.

Always refer to the person interacting with the AI assistant as "the user" rather than using second-person perspective. For example, write "when the user asks for help" instead of "when you ask for help." This establishes a clear distinction between instructions for the AI assistant ("you") and references to the user ("the user"), making it clear that the conversation happens between "you" (the AI Assistant) and "the user."

# Document Structure Guidelines

## Title Placement

Place the main document title in regular paragraph text, not as an H1 heading. This allows H1 headings to be reserved for the main sections of the rule, creating a cleaner document hierarchy.

```markdown
This is the main title of the rule written as regular text.

# First Main Section

## Subsection

### Sub-subsection
```

## Heading Hierarchy

Use H1 (`#`) headings for main sections to establish clear topic boundaries. Structure content with hierarchical headings (`##`, `###`) to organize information logically, creating a clear information hierarchy that mirrors conceptual relationships.

Maintain strict heading hierarchy by progressing sequentially through heading levels (`#` → `##` → `###`) without skipping levels.

## Avoid Deep List Nesting

Instead of creating deeply nested lists, use headings to organize content. This makes the document more scannable and easier to navigate.

### ❌ Problematic Deep Nesting

```markdown
- Main category
  - Subcategory
    - Sub-subcategory
      - Details
        - More details
```

### ✅ Better Structure with Headings

```markdown
# Main Category

## Subcategory

### Sub-subcategory Details

Content about the details goes here.

### More Details

Additional information organized clearly.
```

# Code Block Guidelines

## Avoid Code Blocks in Lists

Never nest code blocks within list items as this creates formatting problems and makes the content harder to read.

### ❌ Problematic Code in Lists

````markdown
- When doing X:
  ```typescript
  const example = "code";
  ```
````

- When doing Y:
  ```typescript
  const another = "example";
  ```

````

### ✅ Better Structure

```markdown
# When Doing X

```typescript
const example = "code";
````

# When Doing Y

```typescript
const another = "example";
```

````

## Code Block Placement

Place code blocks at the document level or under headings, not nested within lists or other complex structures.

# Writing Effective Instructions

## Direct Communication with AI

Rule files communicate exclusively with you, the AI assistant. Structure instructions to be direct and actionable using clear, imperative language.

Frame user interactions using the pattern: "When the user requests X, you must do Y"

## Prefer Generalized Rules Over Narrow Examples

Write directives so they generalize across similar cases, instead of anchoring behavior to a single prop name, component name, or one-off pattern.

- Prefer principle-first wording that applies broadly.
- Use examples only to clarify intent, not to limit scope.
- Avoid example-heavy language that could bias implementation toward a narrow interpretation.

## Clear Role Distinction

Maintain clear distinction between the AI assistant ("you") and the user ("the user") throughout all instructions.

### Proper Instruction Format

```markdown
When the user requests a new component, you must:

# Check Existing Patterns

First examine the existing codebase structure.

# Apply Consistent Naming

Use the established naming conventions.

# Include Documentation

Add comprehensive comments explaining the component's purpose.
````

# Metadata Guidelines

## Required Metadata Block

Begin each rule file with a proper metadata block:

```yaml
---
description: A clear, comprehensive description explaining the rule's purpose and scope
globs: File patterns that trigger automatic rule application
alwaysApply: Boolean indicating if rule applies to all requests
---
```

## Description Writing

Write descriptions that help you quickly identify relevant rules when assisting users with specific tasks. Include the rule's purpose, scope, and key behaviors.

## Glob Patterns

Use glob patterns to match files that should trigger automatic rule application. When files matching the pattern are involved in the user's request, you should automatically consider this rule.

Common glob patterns:

```
src/components/**/*.tsx
packages/**/src/**/*.ts
*.css
```

## Always Apply Setting

Reserve `alwaysApply: true` for fundamental rules that affect all interactions. Most rules should use `alwaysApply: false` and rely on descriptions or globs for activation.

# MDC Link Format

## Proper Link Syntax

When referencing files or directories in rule files, use the MDC link format to create navigable links:

```markdown
[descriptive-link-text](relative/path/from/root)
```

## Link Guidelines

Write descriptive link text, and use correct project-relative paths. Use one link style consistently within the file.

### Examples of Proper MDC Links

```markdown
[Button component](src/components/ui/button.tsx)
[CSS guidelines](AGENTS.md)
[Components directory](src/components)
```

# Content Organization Best Practices

## Scannable Structure

Create content that you can scan quickly to find specific instructions. Use headings to break up large blocks of text and create clear sections.

## Examples and Counter-Examples

Provide concrete examples that demonstrate correct implementation. Use `✅` for good examples and `❌` for problematic patterns to make distinctions clear.

## Reasoning and Context

Explain the reasoning behind important behaviors to help you understand the underlying goals. This enables better decision-making when applying the rules.

# Formatting Guidelines

## Blank Line Management

Maintain proper spacing around headings, paragraphs, and code blocks. These affect both rendering and readability.

## Indentation Precision

Ensure precise indentation for any remaining lists and code blocks. Even small errors can break the document structure.

## Consistent Style

Use consistent formatting throughout the document. This includes heading styles, code block languages, and example formatting.
